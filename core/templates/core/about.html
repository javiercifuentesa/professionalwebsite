                Hi! I'm Javier Cifuentes AvendaÃ±o. My career is built on a foundation of passion for three things: building meaningful business connections, marketing and technology. I began my journey as a customer executive in a large company where I discovered a potential talent in persuasion, negotiation and communication. After realizing that these skills were highly valued in the sales and business department I wanted to explore my performance in this competitive world where many people wanted have success by closing much sales.
                It only took me a few months to prove my success in closing deals and making quick sales. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Since then, I have worked more than 13 years in B2B and B2C sales in various sectors such as telecommunications, industrial, financial and technology. Simultaneously I studied at the Business School of the Universidad Mayor de Chile, graduating as a Management Engineer specialized in Marketing and Business obtaining the highest distinction for my qualifications.

                From the onset of the pandemic, I felt a deep calling to jump on the bandwagon of digital transformation that was coming to change the way all processes from a simple buy to business complex between large companies.

                For me the pandemic was a technological awakening because since I was a teenager I had an affinity and curiosity for technology but for various reasons I never studied a professional career related to it. So I started to sign up for bootcamps and technological courses of programming languages to understand the world of software and web developers. This initiative has a purpose to give a twist to my career for working on tech positions as full stack developer, data analyst or data scientist.
